# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher — a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- `A` → `D`
- `B` → `E`
- `X` → `A`

This project was an opportunity to explore **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. By writing unit tests before implementing the cipher logic, I could:
- Define clear expectations for how the cipher should behave.
- Catch edge cases (like wrapping around the alphabet or handling non-letter characters) early.
- Refactor confidently, knowing tests would catch regressions.

It’s a great demonstration of how even small, classic problems can benefit from a structured, test-first approach.
